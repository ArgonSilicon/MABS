# Solutions

## Exercise 15.1

Now, the equations given in the text become

$$\hat\lambda_1 \hat\lambda_2 = 0.84$$

$$\hat\lambda_1 \hat\lambda_3 = 0.60$$

$$\hat\lambda_2 \hat\lambda_3 = 0.35$$

$$\hat\psi_1 = 1.0 - \hat\lambda_1^2$$

$$\hat\psi_2 = 1.0 - \hat\lambda_2^2$$

$$\hat\psi_3 = 1.0 - \hat\lambda_3^2$$

In this case, the solution for the parameters of a single-factor model is

$$\hat\lambda_1 = 1.2,\  \hat\lambda_2 = 0.7,\  \hat\lambda_3 = 0.5$$

$$\hat\psi_1 = -0.44, \ \hat\psi_2 = 0.51, \ \hat\psi_3 = 0.75$$

Clearly, this solution is unacceptable because of the negative estimate for the first specific variance.
